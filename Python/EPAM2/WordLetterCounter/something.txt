These snakes feed on mammals, birds and reptiles indiscriminately, but seem to prefer
mammals. Roused to activity on sighting prey, the snake will advance with quivering
tail and lunge with open mouth. Live prey is constricted and killed. One or two coils
are used to hold it in a tight grip. The prey, unable to breathe, succumbs and is
subsequently swallowed head first. After a heavy meal, they are disinclined to move.
If forced to, hard parts of the meal may tear through the body. Therefore, if
disturbed, some specimens will disgorge their meal in order to escape from potential
predators. After a heavy meal, an individual may fast for weeks; the longest recorded
duration being 2 years. The python can swallow prey bigger than its size because the
jaw bones are not connected. Morever the prey cannot escape from its mouth because of
unique arrangement of the teeth( which is reverse saw like). So far there have been
no authentic cases of a human being eaten by this species.
